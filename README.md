### What is this repository for? ###

* [The Ornament and Empire Omeka S website](https://ornament.kelsey.lsa.umich.edu/s/ornament-and-empire/page/home) uses the [Foundation](https://omeka.org/s/themes/foundation/) theme to style the website. Using this theme we can make various changes to how the website looks without needing to change the base Omeka code.

* Research Team: Nicola Barham, Leah Bernardo-Ciddio
* Initial Support Partners involved: Joe Bauer, Matt Carruthers, Peter Knoop

<!-- ## General Documentation Standards (in your code) ##

* Remember your audience. The documentation should be written for you to come back to the project in 2 years, or for someone else on the team to pick it up when you get hit by the lottery bus. Don't over document, but make sure someone can get started quickly with no prior knowledge of the project.
* If members of a lab are likely to work with / edit the code directly then include a short README section in each source file -->
